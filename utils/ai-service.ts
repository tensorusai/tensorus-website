Cluster 4 (${cluster4}% of data): Occasional ${clusterTarget} with low engagement. These ${clusterTarget} make infrequent appearances and don't respond consistently to outreach efforts.

Key Metrics Overview:
- Average daily metrics show moderate variability with 12.3% standard deviation
- Mean conversion rate: 4.2% (industry average: 3.7%)
- Overall performance average: 7.8/10

Temporal Patterns:
- Strong weekly cycle with peaks on Tuesday and Wednesday
- Annual seasonality with Q4 showing 37% higher performance than Q2
- 3-month campaign cycles visible in the data

Data Quality:
- 98.7% completeness with no significant gaps
- 2.3% anomalous data points identified and flagged
- High consistency across all measured dimensions

Business Insights:
1. Investment shows 2-week lagged effect on results (ROI: 3.2x)
2. Segments show distinct behavior patterns across categories
3. Price sensitivity varies significantly by segment
4. Resource optimization potential of approximately 15%

This tensor-based analysis reveals opportunities for strategy optimization and resource management improvements that could increase overall efficiency by 8-12% based on our tensor model projections.

I recommend focusing first on the resource allocation optimization, as it shows the highest potential ROI in the short term.`

// Simulate factors response
function simulateFactorsResponse(prompt: string): string {
  return `Based on my tensor analysis, the key factors driving the observed trends are:

1. Seasonal Patterns (37% contribution): Your data shows strong seasonal variations with Q4 performance significantly higher than other quarters. This is likely due to holiday shopping patterns and end-of-year budget spending.

2. Marketing Investment (28% contribution): There's a clear correlation between marketing spend and performance metrics, with a typical 2-week lag between investment and results. The tensor model shows diminishing returns after a certain threshold.

3. Competitive Landscape (15% contribution): External market factors appear to influence your metrics, particularly during periods of high competitive activity. The tensor analysis detected patterns that align with known competitor promotional periods.

4. Day-of-Week Effects (12% contribution): Strong weekly cyclical patterns show that Tuesday and Wednesday are your highest-performing days, while weekends show significantly lower engagement.

5. Price Sensitivity (8% contribution): Different customer segments show varying levels of price sensitivity, with the largest segment (Cluster 2) being the most responsive to pricing changes.

The tensor model suggests that optimizing your marketing spend timing based on these factors could improve overall performance by 15-20%.`

// Simulate confidence response

1. Historical Accuracy: When tested against historical data using a 70/30 train-test split, the model achieved 92% accuracy in predicting directional trends and 85% accuracy in magnitude predictions.

2. Data Quality: Your dataset has high completeness (98.7%) with minimal missing values and consistent formatting, which significantly improves prediction reliability.

3. Pattern Stability: The identified patterns show strong consistency over time, particularly the seasonal and weekly cycles, which increases confidence in forward projections.

4. Anomaly Handling: The model successfully identified and accounted for anomalous data points (2.3% of the dataset), preventing them from skewing predictions.

5. Correlation Strength: The strong correlations between key variables (r > 0.7) provide reliable predictive signals.

However, there are some limitations to consider:
- The model has less confidence in predictions beyond 60 days (confidence drops to 72%)
- Unexpected market disruptions or competitive actions are not accounted for
- The model assumes similar seasonal patterns to previous years

For highest reliability, I recommend updating the model monthly with new data and reviewing predictions quarterly.`

// Simulate recommendation response

1. Optimize Marketing Allocation:

   - Increase investment in channels showing high correlation with conversion (email: 0.76, social: 0.68)
   - Implement a 2-week lead time for campaign launches before expected seasonal peaks

2. Segment-Specific Strategies:
   - For Cluster 1 (high-value customers): Implement a loyalty program with exclusive benefits
   - For Cluster 2 (mid-tier): Focus on upselling during seasonal promotions
   - For Cluster 3 (price-sensitive): Create targeted discount campaigns
   - For Cluster 4 (occasional): Develop re-engagement campaigns with strong incentives

3. Anomaly Response Protocol:
   - Establish automated alerts for metrics deviating more than 2.5 standard deviations
   - Create a cross-functional response team for rapid investigation
   - Develop contingency plans for common anomaly scenarios

4. Forecasting Integration:
   - Update inventory planning to align with the 30/60/90 day forecasts
   - Adjust staffing levels to match predicted demand patterns
   - Set performance targets that account for expected seasonal variations

5. Continuous Improvement:
   - Implement A/B testing to validate the impact of these recommendations
   - Refine the tensor model monthly with new data
   - Expand data collection to include additional variables identified as potentially significant

These recommendations have an estimated potential impact of increasing efficiency by 18% and revenue by 12% over the next quarter.`

   - Low performance: Friday-Sunday (18% below average)
   - This pattern is consistent across all customer segments and product categories

2. Monthly Patterns:
   - First week: Typically 8% above monthly average
   - Last week: 12% above monthly average (likely due to end-of-month targets)
   - Mid-month lull: 5-10% below average during days 12-18

3. Quarterly Patterns:
   - End-of-quarter spikes: Last 2 weeks of each quarter show 25-30% increases
   - Beginning-of-quarter slowdowns: First week typically 15% below average
   - Q4 performance: 37% higher than other quarters

4. Annual Seasonality:
   - Holiday season (Nov-Dec): 45% above annual average
   - Summer slump (Jun-Aug): 12% below annual average
   - Back-to-school period (Aug-Sep): 18% above average
   - January reset: 20% below average

5. Special Event Impact:
   - Promotional events create 3-5 day spikes (average 85% increase)
   - Post-promotion dips: 10-15% below average for 7-10 days following major promotions
   - Competitor events: Detectable 8-12% decreases during major competitor promotions

Understanding these patterns can help you optimize resource allocation, marketing timing, and inventory management to align with these natural cycles.`
